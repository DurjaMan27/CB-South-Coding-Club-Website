            <h2>About the Coding Club</h2>
            <p>
                The Coding Club was founded in 2018 to foster the study of computer science 
                within the CB South Community. Our hope is that everyone who wants to learn code has the opportunity 
                here at this club. We are open to all levels of experience.
            </p>
            <h4>Happy Coding!</h4>
